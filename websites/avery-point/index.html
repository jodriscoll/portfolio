        <h3>Building Community</h3>
        <h4>UConn, Shawmut, and 800 Students</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          The University of Connecticut's goal for the Avery Point project was to encourage more open and informal communication between UConn faculty and students. Our goals were a bit more specific: to complete this complex job to UConn's satisfaction and to do it without disturbing the day-to-day life of students, faculty, and staff. Work included a 7,000 square foot student center designed by Sasaki Associates, a new dining area, lounges, a game room, two outdoor patios, and a 300-seat auditorium. By creating shared spaces, we were able to create a sense of community for students and teachers alike. In fact, to reinforce the idea that this truly was a group effort, we gave frequent tours of the project so we could gather input&mdash;and generate excitement&mdash;from students and faculty.

        <h3>Expecting The Unexpected</h3>
        <h4>A historic storm and a historic find</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Prior to becoming part of the campus in 1967, Avery Point was a US Coast Guard training station. The ship&ndash;like design of the student center, with its sail&ndash;inspired exterior details, harkens to its military past. In the process of renovating the auditorium, we uncovered a large frieze that was blocked by the suspended ceiling. It displayed the Coast Guard motto, "Semper Paratus," or "Always Ready." We encouraged the University to keep the historic piece and adapt it into its new environment. The construction team cleaned and painted it to match the new, polished student auditorium, where it will remain for years to come.
          <br/><br/>
          But the frieze wasn’t the only surprise that came our way. Hurricane Sandy and Blizzard Nemo paid us unwelcome visits and really challenged us to stay on schedule and on budget&mdash;which, we're happy to report, we did.

        <h3>Green is Good</h3>
        <h4>On track for LEED Silver</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          We're proud that all of the materials used for this project came from within 500 miles of Avery Point. And that the building envelope includes partially exposed cast-in-place concrete with a highly decorative façade featuring slate panels made in Vermont and cedar siding strong enough to withstand the coastal environment's strong winds and storms. As a result of these and other measures, the project is on target to receive LEED Silver certification.
